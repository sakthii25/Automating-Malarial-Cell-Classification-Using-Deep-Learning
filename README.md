Automated Malarial Cell Classification

Overview:
Automated Malarial Cell Classification is a deep learning project aimed at revolutionizing the diagnosis of malaria outbreaks. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to automate the classification of malarial cells, reducing the need for manual examination and enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis.

Features:
- Automated classification of malarial cells using a trained deep learning model
- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction with the model
- Efficient and scalable deployment using Streamlit and cloud hosting platforms
- Integration of image processing techniques for preprocessing and analysis of malarial cell images
- High accuracy in distinguishing between malarial and non-malarial cells

Prerequisites:
- Python (version X.X.X)
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X)
- OpenCV (version X.X.X)
- Streamlit (version X.X.X)

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-malarial-cell-classification.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd automated-malarial-cell-classification

2. Launch the Streamlit application:
   streamlit run app.py

3. Access the application by opening the provided URL in your web browser.

Training the Model:
If you wish to train the model using your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset by organizing it into two separate folders: one for malarial cells and another for non-malarial cells.

2. Update the dataset paths in the train.py file.

3. Run the training script:
   python train.py

4. The trained model will be saved in the models directory.
