## Overview

Automated Malarial Cell Classification is a deep learning project aimed at revolutionizing the diagnosis of malaria outbreaks. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to automate the classification of malarial cells, reducing the need for manual examination and enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis.

## Features

- Automated classification of malarial cells using a trained deep learning model
- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction with the model
- Efficient and scalable deployment using Streamlit and cloud hosting platforms
- Integration of image processing techniques for preprocessing and analysis of malarial cell images
- High accuracy in distinguishing between malarial and non-malarial cells

## Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X)
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X)
- OpenCV (version X.X.X)
- Streamlit (version X.X.X)

## Installation
